JS implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock"

After completing the "Rock, Paper, Scissors) track on Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), I decided to see if I could extend it to the 5-element variant "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock". You've probably heard about this from the Big Bang Theory (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSLeBKT7-sM).
The code here follows pretty much the same style as the implementation on Codecademy, although it could stand to be tidied a little bit. I think the "if/else if/else" blocks can be switched to "switch/case" blocks for easier reading. Also, this program only runs 1 time once entered; there should be a way to make it run repeatedly, round after round, until prompted by the user to quit. Also, while the individual scenarios have been written in the code (e.g. "lizard poisons Spock"), the program doesn't say if you've won or if the computer has won.
Suggestions welcome!
